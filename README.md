# EC500 E1: High Performance Computing

## 2018-01-22: Welcome!

Welcome to EC500 E1: High Performance Computing! Over the course of the semester we'll be posting notes, assignments, and reference code segments to this repository. We'll set up a wiki as part of the repo soon, too. For now, look around the repository, take a look at the notes, and let us know if you have any questions.
