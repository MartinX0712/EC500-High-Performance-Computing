Here are some brief notes on installing software in
Ubuntu/an Ubuntu-like terminal.

If you're in Windows 10, I set up an Ubuntu terminal
by following this webpage (and my laptop hasn't died
yet, but it's only been an hour):

www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/

Once that's out of the way, the following commands
are agnostic to a Windows 10 bash shell or an Ubuntu
bash shell.

Installing gcc:
sudo apt-get install gcc

Installing g++:
sudo apt-get install g++

Installing gnuplot:
sudo apt-get install gnuplot

Installing git:
sudo apt-get install git

Python comes pre-installed.
